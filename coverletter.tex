I am applying for the postdoctoral position of the NIH project
"Advancing MR and PET Through Synergistic Simultaneous Acquisition and 
Joint Reconstruction" in your group.

Currently and until March 2015 I am a PhD student in the group of Prof. 
J\"org van den Hoff at Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf (HZDR) dealing with 
the evaluation and improvement of MR-based attenuation correction (MRAC) for 
PET reconstruction.
Your postdoc position strongly fits to me because during my time as a PhD 
student at HZDR, I was able to acquire detailed knowledge about hybrid PET/MR 
imaging using one of the first PET/MR scanners world-wide.

Within the three years of the PhD thesis, I have developed strong skills
in PET/MR imaging.
These skills include:

\begin{itemize}
  \item daily clinical PET/MRI image acquisition, phantom 
        measurements, scanner calibration and quality assurance
  \item medical image analysis and comparison as demonstrated in my
        Magn Reson Mater publication in 2012
  \item development of new algorithms for image segmentation as demonstrated
        in the my publications about truncation and metal artifact in MRAC
  \item experience with simulations about simultaneous reconstruction of
        activity and attenuation as shown in the outlook of my PhD thesis
  \item strong skills in computation in various languages (python, R, C++)
\end{itemize}

I know that your group is one of the most experienced groups in the field of
PET image reconstruction, as you have shown e.g. in the development of MLAA
or MLACF.
Thus, working in your group would be a great chance for me to expand my 
knowledge in PET reconstruction.

In the meantime, I would like to thank you for your time and effort of reviewing 
my application.
