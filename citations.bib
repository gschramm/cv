abstract = {BACKGROUND: Accurate scar assessment is crucial in cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) candidates, since its presence is a negative predictor for CRT response. Therefore, we assessed the performance of different PET parameters to detect scar in CRT candidates. METHODS: Twenty-nine CRT candidates underwent 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG)-PET/computed tomography (CT), resting 13N-NH3-PET/CT and cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) prior to CRT implantation. Segmental 18F-FDG uptake, late 13N-NH3 uptake and absolute myocardial blood flow (MBF) were evaluated for scar detection using late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) CMR as reference. A receiver operator characteristic (ROC) area under the curve (AUC) ≥0.8 indicated a good accuracy of the methods evaluated. RESULTS: Scar was present in 111 of 464 segments. None of the approaches could reliably identify segments with nontransmural scar, except for 18F-FDG uptake in the lateral wall (AUC 0.83). Segmental transmural scars could be detected with all methods (AUC ≥ 0.8), except for septal 18F-FDG uptake and MBF in the inferior wall (AUC < 0.8). Late 13N-NH3 uptake was the best parameter for transmural scar detection, independent of its location, with a sensitivity of 80\% and specificity of 92\% using a cutoff of 66\% of the maximum tracer activity. CONCLUSIONS: Late 13N-NH3 uptake is superior to 13N-NH3 MBF and 18F-FDG in detecting transmural scar, independently of its location. However, none of the tested PET parameters was able to accurately detect nontransmural scar.},

abstract = {The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has impacted the health of humanity after the outbreak in Hubei, China in late December 2019. Ever since, it has taken unprecedented proportions and rapidity causing over a million fatal cases. Recently, a robust Syrian golden hamster model recapitulating COVID-19 was developed in search for effective therapeutics and vaccine candidates. However, overt clinical disease symptoms were largely absent despite high levels of virus replication and associated pathology in the respiratory tract. Therefore, we used micro-computed tomography (μCT) to longitudinally visualize lung pathology and to preclinically assess candidate vaccines. μCT proved to be crucial to quantify and noninvasively monitor disease progression, to evaluate candidate vaccine efficacy, and to improve screening efforts by allowing longitudinal data without harming live animals. Here, we give a comprehensive guide on how to use low-dose high-resolution μCT to follow-up SARS-CoV-2-induced disease and test the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccine candidates in hamsters. Our approach can likewise be applied for the preclinical assessment of antiviral and anti-inflammatory drug treatments in vivo.},

abstract = {Abstract
Importance  During a time with the potential for novel treatment strategies, early detection of disease manifestations at an individual level in presymptomatic carriers of a hexanucleotide repeat expansion in the C9orf72 gene (preSxC9) is becoming increasingly relevant.

Objectives  To evaluate changes in glucose metabolism before symptom onset of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or frontotemporal dementia in preSxC9 using simultaneous fluorine 18–labeled fluorodeoxyglucose ([18F]FDG positron emission tomographic (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging as well as the mutation’s association with clinical and fluid biomarkers.

Design, Setting, and Participants  A prospective, case-control study enrolled 46 participants from November 30, 2015, until December 11, 2018. The study was conducted at the neuromuscular reference center of the University Hospitals Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.

Main Outcomes and Measures  Neuroimaging data were spatially normalized and analyzed at the voxel level at a height threshold of P < .001, cluster-level familywise error–corrected threshold of P < .05, and statistical significance was set at P < .05 for the volume-of-interest level analysis, using Benjamini-Hochberg correction for multiple correction. W-score maps were computed using the individuals serving as controls as a reference to quantify the degree of [18F]FDG PET abnormality. The threshold for abnormality on the W-score maps was designated as an absolute W-score greater than or equal to 1.96. Neurofilament levels and performance on cognitive and neurologic examinations were determined. All hypothesis tests were 1-sided.

Results  Of the 42 included participants, there were 17 with the preSxC9 mutation (12 women [71\%]; mean [SD] age, 51 [9] years) and 25 healthy controls (12 women [48\%]; mean [SD] age, 47 [10] years). Compared with control participants, significant clusters of relative hypometabolism were found in frontotemporal regions, basal ganglia, and thalami of preSxC9 participants and relative hypermetabolism in the peri-Rolandic region, superior frontal gyrus, and precuneus cortex. W-score frequency maps revealed reduced glucose metabolism with local maxima in the insular cortices, central opercular cortex, and thalami in up to 82\% of preSxC9 participants and increased glucose metabolism in the precentral gyrus and precuneus cortex in up to 71\% of preSxC9 participants. Other findings in the preSxC9 group were upper motor neuron involvement in 10 participants (59\%), cognitive abnormalities in 5 participants (29\%), and elevated neurofilament levels in 3 of 16 individuals (19\%) who underwent lumbar puncture.

Conclusions and Relevance  The results suggest that [18F]FDG PET can identify glucose metabolic changes in preSxC9 at an individual level, preceding significantly elevated neurofilament levels and onset of symptoms.},

volume = {7},
year = {2019},
abstract = {Accurate MR-based attenuation correction (MRAC) is essential for quantitative PET/MR imaging of the brain. In this study, we analyze the regional bias caused by MRAC based on Zero-Echo-Time MR images (ZTEAC) compared to CT-based AC (CTAC) static and dynamic PET imaging. In addition, the results are compared to the performance of the Atlas-based AC (AtlasAC) implemented in the GE SIGNA PET/MR software version MP24.

Methods: Thirty static [18F]FDG and eleven dynamic [18F]PE2I acquisitions from a SIGNA PET/MR were reconstructed using ZTEAC (using a research tool, GE Healthcare), single-subject AtlasAC (the default AC in SIGNA PET/MR software version MP24) and CTAC (from a PET/CT acquisition of the same day). In the 30 static [18F]FDG reconstructions, the bias caused by ZTEAC and AtlasAC in the mean uptake of 85 anatomical volumes of interest (VOIs) of the Hammers' atlas was analyzed in PMOD. For the 11 dynamic [18F]PE2I reconstructions, the bias caused by ZTEAC and AtlasAC in the non displaceable binding potential BPnd in the striatum was calculated with cerebellum as the reference region and a simplified reference tissue model.

Results: The regional bias caused by ZTEAC in the static [18F]FDG reconstructions ranged from −8.0 to +7.7\% (mean 0.1\%, SD 2.0\%). For AtlasAC this bias ranged from −31.6 to +16.6\% (mean −0.4\%, SD 4.3\%). The bias caused by AtlasAC showed a clear gradient in the cranio-caudal direction (−4.2\% in the cerebellum, +6.6\% in the left superior frontal gyrus). The bias in the striatal BPnd for the [18F]PE2I reconstructions ranged from −0.8 to +4.8\% (mean 1.5\%, SD 1.4\%) using ZTEAC and from −0.6 to +9.4\% using AtlasAC (mean 4.2\%, SD 2.6\%).

Conclusion: ZTEAC provides excellent quantitative accuracy for static and dynamic brain PET/MR, comparable to CTAC, and is clearly superior to the default AtlasAC implemented in the SIGNA PET/MR software version MP24.},

abstract = {With increasing improvements in the time of flight (TOF) resolution of positron emission tomography (PET) scanners, an accurate model of the TOF measurements is becoming increasingly important. This work considers two parameters of the TOF kernel; the relative positioning of the timing data-bins and the timing resolution along each line of response (LOR). Similar to an existing data-driven method, we assume that any shifts of data-bins along lines of response can be modelled as differences between crystal timing offsets. Inspired by this, timing resolutions of all LORs are modelled as the hypotenuse of timing resolutions of the crystal-pairs in coincidence. Furthermore, in order to mitigate the influence of potential inaccuracies of detector-pair sensitivities on crystal timing resolutions, relative LOR sensitivities are modelled as the product of efficiency factors for the two crystals in coincidence. We validate estimating maps of crystal timing offsets, timing resolutions and efficiencies from the emission data using noisy simulations of a brain phantom. Results are shown for phantom and patient data scanned on clinically available TOF-PET scanners. We find that the estimation of crystal timing resolutions is more sensitive to the data statistics than the estimation of crystal timing offsets. As a result, estimation of crystal timing properties could either be limited to high count emission data, or be obtained utilizing additional regularizations on the estimates. Using a more accurate model of the TOF acquisition, improvements are observed in standard activity reconstructions as well as joint reconstructions of activity and attenuation.},

This facility is optimized for the fast neutron energy range and combines an excellent time structure of the neutron pulses (electron bunch width 5 ps) with a short flight path of 7 m. Because of the low instantaneous neutron flux transmission measurements of neutron total cross sections are possible, that exhibit very different beam and background conditions than found at other neutron sources. © Societá Italiana di Fisica / Springer-Verlag 2013.},
