title = {Improving the quantification accuracy of a PET/CT-scanner with pixelated large area detector},
year = {2016},
abstract = {© 2015 IEEE. One of the main benefits of PET/CT imaging is its ability for absolute quantification. Calibration according to the manufacturer's procedure specifies an accuracy of about 10\%, whereas especially in dynamic clinical studies a higher quantification accuracy is desired. Therefore a more accurate calibration is needed. At the Gemini TF, a scanner with pix-elated large-area LYSO detectors, there are differences in the measurement set-up between calibration and clinical acquisition. This study intends to evaluate the influence of those differences on the calibration with the aim to increase the accuracy of quantification. The major difference herein is the acquisition format, as calibration is performed in histogram-mode (HM-Cal) and clinical acquisition in list-mode format. Using the list-mode format for the calibration (LM-Cal), increases the activity recovery coefficient for the histogram-based acquisition from 0.93 ± 0.08 up to 1.00 ± 0.03. This is however only valid for the calibration set-up but not for clinical situations. Considering more realistic situations like lesions outside the centre of the field of view (FOV) or additional random events coming from highly accumulating regions outside the FOV (like bladder or brain), a different calibration can be found (ALL-Cal). In the evaluation of clinical oncological datasets with low count rates, a significant improvement of the reconstructed mean activity concentration in the bladder (compared to measured urine samples) up to 4\% (LM-Cal) was achieved. For very high count rates the normalization of the scanner has to be adapted to improve the quantification accuracy as well.},

abstract = {Experimental data for the reaction p(n,γ?)d are scarce at energies relevant to Big Bang nucleosynthesis. In network calculations, the reaction rate used relies on theoretical models constrained by nucleon-nucleon scattering data, the capture cross section for thermal neutrons and experimental data of the inverse reaction d(γ?,n)p. The latter reaction - the photodissociation of the deuteron - is also sparsely investigated at Big-Bang energies. A comparison of measurements with precise calculations is difficult due to large experimental uncertainties. To address the need for precise experimental data we started to measure the cross section of the reaction d(γ?,n)p. We use high-intensity bremsstrahlung with an endpoint energy of 5.0 MeV generated at the superconducting electron accelerator ELBE at Forschungszentrum Dresden- Rossendorf. The incoming photon flux is determined by photon scattering at 27Al by measuring the well known transitions at 2.2 and 3.0 MeV with high-purity germanium detectors. With a pulse length of a few ps and an adjustable repetition rate, ELBE offers ideal conditions for precise time-of-flight experiments. For neutron detection we use plastic scintillators read out on two sides by high-gain photomultipliers. With this setup we can measure neutrons between 20 keV and 1.4 MeV with an energy resolution of about 4 \%. The statistical uncertainty reached so far is about 5 \%, the analysis of systematic effects is ongoing. © Copyright owned by the author(s).},
